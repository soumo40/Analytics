# Analytics
One of the many buzzwords in machine learning nowadays is FINTECH. Financial analysts and data scientists all over the world have tried to make sense of the market to find a way to increase their return on investments. However due to various problems, like temporal variability and enormous scale of the system it has proved to be incredibly overwhelming for them even with state of the art data analytic tools.
This project deals with classification of the stock performance using OHLC (O- open, H-high, L-low and C-close) data of a stock comprising 10,000 data points. Conventional machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier and KNN Classifier have been used to predict the target variable ‘y’. Results show a 53% accuracy on the testing data and 54% accuracy for the training data. This report summarizes the methodology, model description, outcomes and references.
